Since I am not a comsci major student, I don't have a lot of experience in web programming. Hence, I expect from this course that I will learn the basics of web programming. For my professors, I expect both the lecturer and laboratory instructor to be considerate and reachable. Lastly, for my classmates, I expect everyone to be cooperative especially those who will be my groupmates.
